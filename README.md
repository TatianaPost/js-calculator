## A javascript calculator in the browser

#### A simple implementation to flex some JQuery, HTML, & CSS

#### Idea from http://www.theodinproject.com/javascript-and-jquery/on-screen-calculator

Live preview (here)[http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/afshinator/js-calculator/blob/master/index.html] though for some reason the font doesnt load on the preview!

These are the buttons that work:

- CA - clear

- the digits

- The simple operators: +, -, *, /

- calculation evaluation: =

- hit 'i' on the keyboard or press the '+/-' part of the image to indicate negative numbers


What it doesn't do yet:

- Even though you can enter numbers via mouse-click on image or keyboard, keyboard entry is not filtered out for error checks.
