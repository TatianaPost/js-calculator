- Idea from <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/javascript-and-jquery/on-screen-calculator" target="_blank">this Odin Project challenge.</a>

- Live preview [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/afshinator/js-calculator/blob/master/index.html), though for some reason the font doesnt load on the preview!


#### These are the buttons that work:

- CA - clear

- the digits

- The simple operators: +, -, *, /

- calculation evaluation: =

- hit 'i' on the keyboard or press the '+/-' part of the image to indicate negative numbers


**What it doesn't do yet:**

- Even though you can enter numbers via mouse-click on image or keyboard, keyboard entry is not filtered out for error checks.

- Calculations are pretty much limited to whole numbers; fractional numbers will scroll off-screen.
